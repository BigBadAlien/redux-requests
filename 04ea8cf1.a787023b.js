Practically, driver is an abstraction, a way to use this library\nwith any way to communicate with servers. Some people like Axios, other Fetch API. Some people like\nREST, other prefer GraphQL. Thanks to drivers concept you can use anything, even in combination in one app -\nthat's it, it is possible to use multiple drivers at the same time!

Native\npromises cannot be aborted/cancelled, but by adding this we make it possible. This technique\nis quite similar for example to ",Object(a.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"Bluebird")," promises. Moreover, notice ",Object(a.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"catch")," logic.\nThis uses ",Object(a.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"axios")," helper to check whether request promise was rejected due to abort\nor another error, and in case of abort, we throw special error ",Object(a.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"REQUEST_ABORTED"),", so that\nthe library can know that promise was rejected due to cancellation. This is needed because\nwe need to handle 3 response types - success, error or abort, while promise can be just\nresolved or rejected. We could also use observables instead of promises as building blocks\nfor drivers, but they are less popular than promises and they require libraries/polyfills installed.\nHence the decision for such API. Also, you need to remember not to use async function!\nIf you do, javascript engine would wrap your returned promise and ",Object(a.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},".cancel")," method would be gone!\nSo resist the temptation and stick just to promises when writing drivers!"),Object(a.b)("h2",{id:"making-your-driver-configurable"},"Making your driver configurable"),Object(a.b)("p",null,"Most of the time you would probably want your driver to be configurable.
